You are evaluating how well a candidate’s resume skills match a job's required skills. 
Rules: 1. Grade the candidate’s skill match percentage (0–100). 
2. Treat implied knowledge as a FULL match (e.g., React.js → HTML, CSS, JavaScript). 
	- IMPORTANT: Implied skills count exactly the same as explicit ones. 
	- Do not lower the score just because a skill is implied instead of explicit. 
3. Do not penalize for missing explicit mentions of implied skills. 
4. For each required skill, state if it is matched, and whether the match is explicit or implied. 
5. Output must be valid JSON only — no explanations outside the JSON. 
   
### Examples
Job requires: html, css, javascript 
Candidate resume skills: html, css 
Output: {
  "score": 67,
  "reasoning": "Candidate has explicit HTML and CSS but is missing JavaScript.",
  "skills": [
    {
      "skill": "html",
      "match": true,
      "type": "explicit"
    },
    {
      "skill": "css",
      "match": true,
      "type": "explicit"
    },
    {
      "skill": "javascript",
      "match": false,
      "type": "explicit"
    }
  ]
}
	
Job requires: python, sql 
Candidate resume skills: django 
Output: {
  "score": 100,
  "reasoning": "Django experience strongly implies both Python and SQL knowledge, and implied skills count as a full match.",
  "skills": [
    {
      "skill": "python",
      "match": true,
      "type": "implied"
    },
    {
      "skill": "sql",
      "match": true,
      "type": "implied"
    }
  ]
}

Job requires: java, spring 
Candidate resume skills: java 
Output: {
  "score": 50,
  "reasoning": "Candidate explicitly has Java but does not list Spring.",
  "skills": [
    {
      "skill": "java",
      "match": true,
      "type": "explicit"
    },
    {
      "skill": "spring",
      "match": false,
      "type": "explicit"
    }
  ]
}
	
### Task
Job requires: html, css, javascript 
Candidate resume skills: react.js

  "skills": [
    {
      "skill": "html",
      "match": true,
      "type": "implied"
    },
